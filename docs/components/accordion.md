# 🪗 Accordion

Ever need to avoid throwing too much text at someone all at once, and let them unfold it bit by bit, at their own pace? **The accordion is your instrument!** 🪗 Tap a heading, the section opens; tap again, it tucks away. Every header wears a ▸ that turns into ▾ once open — the cue that says "there is more here". Perfect for FAQs, long references, or anything worth discovering on demand.

**This page is the tutorial.** Click 📽️ at the bottom-left to enter slide mode.

### 🐍 What is Python?
Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language known for its readable syntax. Used for web, data science, AI, scripting, and more.

### 🤔 Do I need to install anything?
No — this site runs Python directly in your browser using WebAssembly. Nothing to install, nothing to configure.

### 🏁 How do I get started?
Go to the [🐍 Run](/components/run) page, edit the code, and hit ▶ Run. That's the whole setup.
```
{: .accordion }

Click each section to open it. Click again to close.

```gherkin
Feature: Accordion panels toggle independently
  As a reader
  I want sections that expand and collapse on click
  So that I can reveal long content at my own pace

  Scenario: A closed panel opens when its header is clicked
    Given the accordion above with every panel closed
    :::python
    self.panels: list = Object._all(".lc-accordion")[0]._qq("details")
    for p in self.panels: p._el.removeAttribute("open")
    :::
    When I click the first panel's summary
    :::python
    self.panels[0]._tap("summary")
    :::
    Then the first panel is open
    :::python
    assert self.panels[0]._el.open
    :::

  Scenario: An open panel closes when its header is clicked again
    Given the accordion above with the first panel open
    :::python
    self.panels: list = Object._all(".lc-accordion")[0]._qq("details")
    self.panels[0]._el.setAttribute("open", "")
    :::
    When I click the first panel's summary
    :::python
    self.panels[0]._tap("summary")
    :::
    Then the first panel is closed
    :::python
    assert not self.panels[0]._el.open
    :::

  Scenario: Two panels can be open at once
    Given the accordion above with every panel closed
    :::python
    self.panels: list = Object._all(".lc-accordion")[0]._qq("details")
    for p in self.panels: p._el.removeAttribute("open")
    :::
    When I open the first and second panels
    :::python
    self.panels[0]._tap("summary")
    self.panels[1]._tap("summary")
    :::
    Then both panels stay open
    :::python
    assert self.panels[0]._el.open and self.panels[1]._el.open
    :::

{: .speaker-note }

**Q:** Two accordion sections are open at the same time. Is that allowed?

- [x] Yes — each `<details>` is independent; any number can be open.
- [ ] No — opening one closes the others (like a real accordion instrument).
- [ ] Only if you add `multi="true"` to the IAL.
- [ ] Only the first section can be open. The rest are decorative.
{: .quiz }

## 🛠️ How to make one

Write a plain fenced block (no language tag), use `### Heading` to start each section, then add `{: .accordion }` on the very next line:

````markdown
```
### ❓ First question
Answer goes here. Full **markdown** works — bullets, links, `code`.

### ❓ Second question
Another answer.
```
{: .accordion }
````

**Q:** You write `## Heading` instead of `### Heading` inside the fenced block. What happens?

- [ ] A bigger heading appears inside the accordion panel.
- [x] That section is ignored — only `### ` (h3) acts as the section separator.
- [ ] The whole accordion fails silently.
- [ ] It becomes the accordion's outer title, not a panel.
{: .quiz }

## 🔧 No extra knobs

Accordion has no extra IAL attributes — the structure comes entirely from `### ` headings and body content. Full markdown is supported in every panel body: bullets, tables, `code`, bold, links, even [🐍 Run](/components/run) runners.

## 🪄 The same accordion, from a heading

One level up, same instrument, same IAL: put `{: .accordion }` on the line
**under a heading** and that heading folds its own section — everything down to
the next heading of the same or higher level. The heading keeps its look, its id
and its anchor; it simply becomes the panel's handle. `open="true"` starts it
unfolded.

````markdown
## 5. 🏠 The desk
{: .accordion open="true" }

Everything under this heading folds with it.
````

A long page becomes a menu: the reader opens the one section they came for.
Nothing is re-rendered when a panel opens — the content is moved, not rebuilt —
so grids, proofs and diagrams inside a shut section are alive from page load.

```gherkin
Feature: A heading folds its own section
  Scenario: The demo below is a panel the reader opens
    Given the heading's panel
    :::python
    self.demo: Accordion = self.page.try_it
    :::
    Then it wears the heading as its handle
    :::python
    assert "Try it" in " ".join(self.demo.sections()), self.demo.sections()
    :::
    When a reader opens it
    :::python
    self.demo.open()
    :::
    Then the section is theirs to read
    :::python
    assert "unfolded it" in self.demo.text, self.demo.text[:120]
    :::
```
{: .feature tags="ui" status="passing"}

### 🎪 Try it — this very heading is a panel
{: .accordion #try_it }

You just unfolded it. Click the heading again to tuck it away. Notice the
heading kept its size and its emoji: no new widget, the accordion took the
heading as its handle.

## 💤 A panel is lazy — unless you say `!`

A fenced panel renders when a reader opens it. That is what keeps a page
light when a section holds something heavy (this is how a course page folds a
3D scene away). But a panel nobody opened has **nothing inside it** — a form,
a runner or a check in there does not exist yet, and a proof elsewhere on the
page cannot reach it.

Start the section's title with `!` and the body is built as the page loads,
still folded:

````markdown
```
### !🖥 The app
A form and a button, alive from the first paint.

### 📖 The long story
Rendered only if someone asks for it.
```
{: .accordion }
````

A heading panel never needs this: its content *is* the page, always there,
folded or not.

## ⚠️ Limits worth knowing

- **No exclusive mode** (one-open-at-a-time). Each panel is a native `<details>` element — open/close is handled by the browser with no JS.
- **Same format as Tabs and Radio.** Accordion, tabs, and radio all use the same `### ` fenced-block source. Swap the IAL class to switch widget type with no other changes.
- **A section panel is furniture, not a component.** It wears no component id, so nothing binds to it. Address a folded section by its heading's anchor.

## 🏁 Final exam

**Q:** Which of these are TRUE about the accordion? (Pick all that apply.)

- [x] `### ` headings inside the fenced block become panel labels.
- [x] Multiple panels can be open simultaneously.
- [ ] You need `multi="true"` to allow more than one open panel.
- [x] Full markdown works inside each panel body.
- [x] Swapping `{: .accordion }` to `{: .tabs }` gives the same content as tabs.
