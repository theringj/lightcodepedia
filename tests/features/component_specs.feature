Feature: Component specs run green

  Hidden .feature blocks embedded on component pages must pass when executed
  by the in-browser MicroPython step runner. This dogfoods the runtime: the
  component's own model classes drive its live demo and assert the behaviour.

  Scenario: A reader who opens only the proof still sees it pass
    The sweep opens every fold before running a page's checks, so a proof
    that leans on a panel the reader never opened passes here and fails on
    the page (2026-09-02: the app panel lost its eager "!" and the check
    went red for everyone but this suite). This one opens what a reader opens.

    Given I have a clean browser page
    When I navigate to "/courses/python/elevator_pitch"
    And I wait for the page to be interactive
    And I open only the "Does it work?" section
    And I run the features in that section
    Then every embedded feature passes

  Scenario: Fun with functions spec passes
    Play first, read later: two buttons that are two functions, a guess to
    make before the cup cools, and the same program as plain Python
    (Michel, 2026-09-07). Its own proof drives the model and reads the
    verdict back.

    Given I have a clean browser page
    When I navigate to "/courses/python/fun"
    And I wait for the page to be interactive
    And I wait for the selector "[data-lc-inspector='choco'] button[data-m='cool']"
    And I run the page's embedded features
    Then every embedded feature passes

  Scenario: Elevator pitch spec passes
    The students' example: an app on the left, its Python on the right. Its
    own proof drives the form and reads the printed line back, so a page
    whose cells stopped following the learner's words fails here.

    Given I have a clean browser page
    When I navigate to "/courses/python/elevator_pitch"
    And I wait for the page to be interactive
    And I wait for the selector ".lc-form-grid .ag-row"
    And I run the page's embedded features
    Then every embedded feature passes
