Feature: Folder shelf — read posture and X-ray workbench
  The .folder component has two postures. READ (default): the listing minus
  every writing affordance — no ➕ New, underscore files hidden. X-RAY (the
  mode): the shelf becomes a workbench — ➕ New returns, every file shows,
  and each file card grows a ⚙️ menu with rename / move / trash. Trash is a
  move into _trash/ with a _deleted_<timestamp> suffix — recoverable.

  Scenario: Read posture lists pages with no writing affordances
    Given I have a clean browser page
    And a marked shim is preinstalled
    And a builder key is connected
    And the folder "courses/demo/mod" serves pages "alpha.md,_hidden.md"
    And the GitHub contents API serves "courses/demo/mod/index.md" with the document:
      """

    And I wait for the page to be interactive
    Then the shelf shows a card for "Alpha"
    And the shelf hides "Hidden" and every writing affordance

  Scenario: The shelf names its module and marks the page you are on
    A list of siblings said neither what it was a shelf OF nor which card
    was the page under the reader's feet (Michel, 2026-08-11).

    Given I have a clean browser page

    Then the file "courses/demo/mod/notes.md" was created

  Scenario: Cards keep their real titles when a stale raw token 404s
    On a private repo the listing's download_url carries a SHORT-LIVED
    token. Served from cache, those tokens have expired — the raw fetch
    404s and every card silently degrades to its filename with no snippet,
    no tags, no dots: the same folder rendering differently between visits.
    The content must come through the door we are authenticated for.

    Given I have a clean browser page
    And a builder key is connected
    And the folder "courses/demo/mod" lists "01_adoption_day.md" whose raw token is stale
    When I navigate to "/run.html#src=gh:acme/demo/courses/demo/mod/index.md"
    And I wait for the page to be interactive
    Then the shelf shows a card for "Adoption Day"

  Scenario: A subfolder card keeps its title when the raw token has expired
    The page cards were fixed for this; the SUBFOLDER half was missed. Its
    index.md was still read through download_url — an unauthenticated raw
    URL carrying a SHORT-LIVED token. Served from cache the token has aged
    out, the read 404s, so a module card degraded to its directory name
    ("Module 00") with no title, no snippet — differently from one visit to
    the next, which is why it was impossible to reproduce on demand.

    Given a stubbed private repo whose raw tokens have expired
    When I open a shelf listing that repo
    Then the subfolder card shows the index's own title

  Scenario: parent="true" offers the way up, out of the folder
    A reader who finished a module needs to climb one level before they can
    pick the next one, and a list of siblings cannot offer that. The knob is
    opt-in because "up" is not always somewhere useful — at the root it is
    nowhere at all.

    Given I have a clean browser page
    And a marked shim is preinstalled
    And a builder key is connected
    And the folder "courses/demo/mod" serves pages "alpha.md"

    And the way up is not a card in the grid

  Scenario: The way up is a pill in the bar, labelled just "Up"
    It used to be a line under the cards reading "⬆️ up to micro_build_ai" —
    a whole row spent naming a folder the reader is about to see anyway. It is
    now a pill in the chip bar, in the same far-right slot ➕ New takes when
    the shelf is writable: one place for "the thing you do here that is not
    picking a card", whichever mode you are in.

    And the way up is pushed to the far end of the bar
    And a way up to the folder above is offered
    And the way up is not a card in the grid

  Scenario: From a lesson, Up goes to the module's own front page
    Michel, 2026-08-06: "'Up' should go to the index of that folder if not
    already there, otherwise in the parent's index page." The pill used to
    climb one level from wherever it was placed, so finishing a lesson threw
    the reader clean out of the module instead of dropping them at its front
    door — the one page that says what the module is and lists what is left.

    rides every hop inside (Michel, 2026-08-13).

  Scenario: A module recap counts quizzes and proofs, and links to what remains
    Before a graded check, a learner juggling three classes and a job wants
    one factual line per page: what they earned, what they missed, what is
    left — and a link to finish it. Module-scoped, no prose, points =
    quizzes ok + proofs green (Michel, 2026-09-06). The records arrive from
    the bench's progress file, so a phone shows the laptop's work.

  Scenario: The teacher's shelf reads a vault the author key cannot
    An author key is owner-scoped; the vault is the org's. The runner
    already retries a page with the cockpit's org key, so the page rendered
    — and the recap on it said HTTP 404 (Michel, 2026-09-07). The shelf
    falls back the same way; learners hold no org key and are untouched.

    And I wait for the page to be interactive
    Then the recap head reads "0 of 1 pages done"
    And the recap key line says "Key saved 27 days ago"

  Scenario: In a module-scoped frame, a lesson still climbs to the module's front page
    Scoped means no way OUT of the module, not no way back to its index:
    on the Essentials page of module 00, framed with ?up=0, there was no
    way up to the module page the learner came from (Michel, 2026-09-07).

    Given I have a clean browser page
    And a marked shim is preinstalled
    And a builder key is connected
    And the folder "courses/demo/mod" serves pages "alpha.md"
    And the GitHub contents API serves "courses/demo/mod/lesson.md" with the document:
      """
      # A lesson

      [in this module](#)
      {: .folder parent="true" }
      """
    When I navigate to "/run.html?up=0#src=gh:acme/demo/courses/demo/mod/lesson.md"
    And I wait for the page to be interactive
    Then the shelf shows a card for "Alpha"
    And the way up leads to "courses/demo/mod/index.md"
